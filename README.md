Hey there! You probably noticed this is not a very active place, I still post repositories and snippets from time to time. In another time I used to contribute to projects using the monchitos82 account (_now deactivated_). 

If you feel like contacting me, I'm available at my full name at gmail.

### About me (02/24)

I have been a computer systems engineer for the past two decades. I have some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large number (I can also play with raspberries), write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to meet people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring, but I am more of a jack of all trades so I end up learning more from others.

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries and continued that streak with my professional life.

I may come back here from time to time and speak of things I have in my mind. I don't contribute to any other social media platforms, I like to be the only loon in my feed, so yeah that's it.

### Simplicity is king in my world (02/24)

In the gist of many things going on lately around my own life I come close in contact with a lot of complaints about how things keep degrading in quality and surging in price and I keep reaching over and over again to the same conclusion: simple was, is and will always be better. Focusing on shells full of gimmicks tends to always have the same outcome yet we often just don't get it. I usually am triggered by buzzwords like _slice and dice_ or _democratize_ but I come to really sympathize with this one: _enshitification_.

I like my code with zero boilerplate, my internet with zero limits, my services with zero subscriptions and the list goes on. I am not against progress, progress is good, that's why cars are safer and phones are faster, yet this decade all we get are flashy pinatas solving no problem, but the problem created to keep the greedy appeased. I never realized how much I miss what is simple and reliable. Screw those flashy trims and non-sense all glued together gadgets, let's go back to simple, there's where beauty of crafting lies, that's where we have control.

### Is my connection the issue? (07/24)

Recently I got this as feedback from an interview: _"Your internet connection seems poor"_. I was concerned about it since I want to work remotely when the chance is there without driving my family crazy by hogging the network. I knew I had 150 symmetric Mbps, so what's wrong then? Well, I had no clue, but I could start by monitoring and a quick search got me this neat python library: [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/wiki), so the nerd in me took the chance to write a prometheus sensor and poll the metric constantly. I wrote a non-prod-ready **[gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mon-gmx/8b70cc44a4bf37c0015db1000fb83abc/raw/24ab84640b7c25dc11d002b9940f59f6a8ce7dae/speed_test_sensors.py)** for that matter that paired to a systemd service got me monitoring my internet speed in no time. Now to what matters: it is not my connection the one that sucks, yes, it is slow by today's standards, but never degraded below the 90Mbps in any direction, and that's why data trumps everything and why observability is a must whenever dealing with problems where the root cause is not so evident. Will I dig further here? Hell yes, I have `iperf` measuring different latencies between different antennas (my network is simple: `modem -> router -> repeaters (mesh) -> computers`).

### My two cents on "coding" interviews (07/24)

Yes I am one of those guys. I see no benefit to them other than stress the shit out of a person to no good end. I would say I am the same as happy doing these interviews as I am creating 1 machine clusters using kubernetes. Two of the most enjoyable interview processes I had (and memorable since they really demanded more skills than memorizing algorithms or snooping over the answers tab) were with Klarna and Wizeline; Klarna asked me not only to provide complex functions but to actually write a service to query those functions and emit metrics for them (2 days given for the task) and Wizeline asked me to write a function in a language they invented so they could evaluate my ability to learn and work with what I learned (no guy on the other side of the terminal). I wish I could mention Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft of Meta here, but nope, they all do the same silly handshake, so I dare to say that I don't see this inventive anywhere in big tech, I know, the process was created to pick the brightest, but just as with immigration, it is gamed and not fun at all. So this is the hill I choose to die on: leetcode is crap, I will always push back on it. Not saying puzzles are crap, they are not, they are fun and educational, but using them as the first step to filter out the competence of a candidate is silly, just like certifications.

### A small parenthesis on capacity (09/24)

I will start this one by posting a term I forgot to mention in a recent conversation: **load testing**

Capacity planning is a very interesting discussion; it requires knowing where you're standing and where you're going. I just had a conversation where we discussed vertical vs. horizontal scaling. But the conversation can only start when you know where you are standing and for that understanding to happen, you need to know what are your current limits (limits are good, this is one of the most important lessons I have ever learned in my career), that's where load testing comes into play. Yes, you will add buffering in different layers to disperse the load and you will break the problem you try to solve to improve your ability to scale, but that is step number two.

### Why ChatGPT is (for now) my best pair programming amigo (11/24)

Using ChatGPT to code is like shooting at your own feet, except that IMO, it has been the best companion ever. I would guess co-pilot would be fairly efficient, but I am budget restricted to try it. Anyway, I find the capacity of bouncing ideas with the GAI a big up that if handled with care can boost productivity.
Unlike using stackoverflow, which I despise, ChatGPT will lay the mines right under your feet. They will blow before you ship, which is a good thing to find out. If you are careful enough with what you ask for, with reading what you got served and with being critical to the response, probably you can get better code. Not saying it is easy though, GPT is terribly bad at getting good and consistent unit tests, however it is brilliant at providing useful mocks so that's a big tradeoff.
So what am I suggesting here? Should you replace all your tools for using ChatGPT? Nah, but there are a few you for sure will want to get rid off: Google being the first one. If you can search through your prompt (hey, hey! just don't trust everything it says!), the only other thing you need is access to github (GPT is not actual and deprecated and bad code may be replied). So having the changelog, API descriptions and a peer that reviews your ideas is like a powerful trifecta, that in my case, has helped me ship at least 5 projects in less than a couple months. Am I grateful for it? You bet! Am I afraid it will replace me? Nah, it will get better when it can handle context and when that happens, I will be grateful for the transition :robot:💙
I truly believe that it is a good mentor, but what's remarkable of all of this, is that if you pay close attention, you are setting the pace and you are reasoning with yourself, it is like looking into a warped mirror to get a fresh perspective of what you can actually do with a little more time and a better education.

### Beware on what you learn... and what you skip learning (12/24)

So I just came back from a two week trip. That means, it is time for me to shake up the rust. Well, not only I like to do that on my coding skills, but the design ones. I like putting about an hour daily to go through blogs or lately videos on design mocks and well, I found a full playlist with those and oh boy, some are so flawed that I just feel bad for those taking notes from them. I criticize without having a better recipe, yet I think there are some fundamentals you cannot just toss away and hope for a good result, e.g. if you design an API, you want to follow REST principles so your API is not your weakest link. Same I could say for caching or other buffering solutions, they are mentioned but never brought into consideration on what could be their caveats or simply their strategies.
I used to think NALSD was the coolest thing ever in a design interview, but surely, it is not a single thing, it's the collection of all parts that makes the task not only enjoyable, but worth exercising. So if I had to write a list on things you need to pay attention to provide good solutions I would be keen on using what you understand well and only add up new pieces where you know bottlenecks usually are, this sounds kind of counterintuitive in a world where big tech tells you their shit is a panacea, but a cake of layers rarely makes things better and -true story- they are experts in making cakes.

Moving on; since I am not fully occupied at the moment, I thought it was a good time to actually learn a new skill that I indefinitely postponed like: a mobile application. My idea was simple: a localization app that can give me useful data (for a traveler), location (coordinates and nearby address), weather and time. Nothing fancy, text would work. I downloaded Android studio and started writing something (with the help of tutorials and AI, since I had zero idea on how to set up a project, let alone write Kotlin). Well, my project was ready to be tested except I was missing API keys. And well, in a distant decade ago, I would just need to generate my key using my Google account. Sadly those days are gone. I was welcomed with the GCP mess of a landing page where the first thing I needed to add was my fiscal information and a credit card. **Hell no!**

So I wrapped my project, hit `rm -rf MyWeatherApp` and came in here to rant about how bad things are where all content is social, all infra is rented, all projects are a layered mess of YAMLs and XMLs, all services are (public) cloud hosted and even all useful advice is subscription restricted. Yes, I advocate for a system where you pay for what you use, yet I cannot just put out $20 bucks on every step I take and get nowhere, I start to fear that productivity is for sale under this weird world big tech crafted for us. It saddens me because it resembles the reality I live beyond this screen where a mob and a caste of parasitic politicians extort you by forcing you to pay protection money so you just can make a living.

I would argue that open-source would be a valid alternative, and it is to some extent, but eventually we hit the spot where we need to use something google authored and I guess my frustration here is how much worse things are thanks to G and friends. 

My small victory from all this wiggling is that ChatGPT is terrible, as usual, writing a good solution so it forces me to at the very least troubleshoot what it suggests. So at the end of the exercise, I learned something.

### On frameworks and languages... and AI (12/24)

Yes, this is one more of those posts. I was just exploring the whatabouts of FastAPI. I was interested in how hard or how easy it is to get it to work compared to Flask or Django 🤮
I find that it is super easy to get it working and I really liked, but to be fair, it still brings a bunch of dependencies that a language like Go just natively has (Go's tooling is sleek). And that brought me to the questioning on why are frameworks proliferating at all? Not long ago I spent some time reading about the need to push back on things like React and come to believe that if JavaScript had offered a bunch of much needed functionality like async calls, a lot of these framework nightmares would simply not exist. Yes, JavaScript is a terrible example, but thinking about Java, well, it is not very different, and possibly the list just goes on because, well, if the language is complete, and getting things done does not require an obscene amount of code, do you really need the framework?

I don't have many friends I can bring on the conversation and ended up asking ChatGPT about this and well, it started using a lot the term "overengineering" which brought the conversation from Frameworks and language feature completeness to more weird concepts like cloud native applications and to even harder topics like accountability and why engineering is a very condescending word in a world of do as you go.

Anyway FastAPI is nice, but old me thinks Golang is nicer, even when it has some weird traits.

### tmpfs (01/25)

I won't delve here into tmpfs because I don't know where it started beyond what [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs) has. However, if you ever worked with a raspberry, you know SD card lifetime is limited and I come to find that tmpfs has been a time and money saver since I minimized the writing in my storage by using it. Yet as you may expect, this is ephemeral (since it is saving data into a block in the RAM) so yes, this has two drawbacks actually, you lose memory for the sake of having a temporary place to write. Is it worth it? IMO yes. Any permanent (and important) storage I have deferred to external drives, but external drives are slow. Things like logs, go to the tmpfs for sure.

So how easy is to get this going?

Actually it is pretty simple. To the extent to say it comes out of the box, so pretty much all I needed is:
1. Add the entry to my `/etc/fstab` file`
2. Add the dirs (this is a minor ache) that need services like nginx back to the filesystem in order not to have startup failure upon restart; file: `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/var.conf`

The entries of each file are quite simple:
```
# fstab
# in this case, we specify we mount /var/log as tmpfs with 400MB size
tmpfs  /var/log  tmpfs  defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,mode=0755,size=400M  0  0

# var.conf <- this would go for any filesystem that actually is mounted
# in this case, we specify we want a dir for nginx with owner www-data in the path
d /var/log/nginx 0755 www-data www-data -
```

And just like that, I have kept my SD cards alive for close to two years. Probably with a v.5 this is not needed if you just use a NVMe, but that's not a cheap option when dealing with more than one board.

### Onboarding is underestimated (01/25)

After watching the NVIDIA CES keynote a couple of days ago, many ideas resonated with me. However, one in particular stood out as challenging: onboarding agents as a key process. The reason I am writing this post is that I believe we often overlook how important good onboarding is. I have a few stories, some of success and many of horror, and they all begin, well, at the start. Whether it’s joining a new team, entering a new organization, or taking on a new responsibility, the process of transferring knowledge is an art that, especially in engineering, few have mastered. This is often because it’s perceived that there are more pressing things to do.

Onboarding is no simple task; it requires dedication. It’s easy to think that writing a checklist and passing it on to the newcomer will suffice. In reality, this approach dismisses the unique circumstances surrounding the newcomer and makes assumptions that might be wrong. It was only recently that I realized one of the best things that happened in my career was starting in a place where most people were not only good at their jobs but also great mentors. Conversely, every single time I failed to catch up or decided to pursue a different path, it was triggered by the perception that there was no investment in helping me start. By “investment,” I mean time and will.

I also like to think that my best contribution to my former job at LinkedIn was helping engineers, regardless of their position, get up to speed. It demanded a significant toll on my time and ability to deliver other projects, but I regret nothing. The people I onboarded have seen their careers thrive to this day, and that makes me believe every minute invested was worth it.

Onboarding and mentoring overall are not simple. You may know many things or quite a few, but the real challenge lies in understanding where to start with the person you’re bringing in. Too often, I’ve been in situations where the person tasked with onboarding me approached the task with the same level of commitment as any other item on their to-do list. The result was poor not only for me as the one being onboarded but also for the organization. Having a new person join and contribute from the start would be fantastic, but that requires another person to step away from their tasks to prioritize knowledge transfer and training. Unfortunately, not many engineers or managers are willing to make that sacrifice.

As AI takes over many key positions, I believe the approach to onboarding will need to change. After all, a well-trained model is a productive model. Passing on knowledge will become a paramount activity for many organizations, and it’s about time. The investment in time and effort always pays off.


### Moving to RSS (01/25)

This sounds like something one would do in the early 2000's, but I think that after the first quarter of the century has passed, it is only sane to stop using any kind of social media and well, this change kinda fulfills my needs. I tried to become active starting this year in the only network I used (LinkedIn), but even if I loved being part of the company, I don't love the product, so I am ditching it. This would be just another post of people fleeing away from different platforms into "safe spaces", but I think I don't care about those ideas, social media was meant to bring you close to the people that once were part of your life, however it is not strange that I find myself in a room full of relatives staring at different screens at the same time, talking to no one, and I just think that these sites just keep making worse and worse the internet for everyone, so it is time to get away.

It is a no brainer that these algorithms used for "relevance" are just means to amplify what's controversial for the sake of "engagement", these are just fancy terms for giving more room to content that will block time and attention from the users, but rarely this is a healthy kind of content; controversial more often than not are comments and scenarios that are not realistic and tend to harm your mental well being, just like pornography. I don't want to be part of it, not even as a user, thus, I am going back to when the internet was exciting.
